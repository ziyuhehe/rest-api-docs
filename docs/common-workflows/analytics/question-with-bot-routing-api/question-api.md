With our newly added question with bot routing APIs, you can inquire all bots within the entire application without the need to manually identify the appropriate bot. The API automatically determines the most suitable bot to address your questions. Additionally, you have the option to specify the search scope using content groups and bot IDs for more accurate responses.

The question with bot routing APIs enable bots to offer suggested questions, assisting you in discovering relevant queries and answers more efficiently. Additionally, we have enhanced the API to facilitate direct output of visualizations as PNG images, streamlining the process of viewing and interpreting visual data.
